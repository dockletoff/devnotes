## arrays

Arrays are like a PO box at the post office mail bank (wall of PO boxes).

They are indexed starting at 0.

If an array consists of n elements, the final element will be located at index (n -1);

eg if an array has 50 elements, the first will be indexed at 0 and the last at 49

Array declarations:

type name[size] 

type = data type (eg int, float, string)
name = name of the array;
size = how many elements are contained in the array;

You can declare and initialize an array at the same time by either

// instantation syntax 

bool true_orfalse[4] = {true, false, true, false}

(note that you actually don't need to define the size of the array when initialising (eg 4) as the computer can figure this out for you

or

// individual element syntax 

bool true_orfalse[4];
true_orfalse[0] =  true;
true_orfalse[1] =  false;
true_orfalse[2] =  true;
true_orfalse[3] =  false;

## arrays can also consist of more than one dimension
eg bool battleship_board [a][10]

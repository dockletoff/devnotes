# using a variable

after a variable has been declared, it's no longer necessary to specify that variable's type.

int number;     // declaration
number = 17;    // assignment
char letter;    // declaration
letter = 'H'    // assignment

if you are simultaneously declaring and setting the value of a variable (called initializing) , you can consolidate this in one step

int number = 17;    // initialization
char letter = 'H';  // initialization


## booleans or bools

bool = a bool is a data type that can hold one of two values: true or false (or 0/1; yes/no)

often used to control the flow of function in:

if-else statements ie (if true - execute function) else (if not true - execute function)
or in while loops (eg while 0/1, execute function)
or in for loops (eg for y/n, execute function)

## integers

a whole number that is 4 bytes or 32 bits

there are also unsigned integers. unsigned is a qualifier that effectively doubles the positive range of integers but 
eliminates the negatives 

unsigned int

##### characters or chars

one byte

###### floating points 

4 bytes or 32 bits

the float data type will store numbers with decimal parts also known as real numbers. They are limited with how many 
decimals they can store

######## doubles

doubles are 8 bytes or 64 bits
these deal with the precision number problem of floats


########### strings

strings are a series of characters

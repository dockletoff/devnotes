# while loops

normally used when you want a loop to repeat an unknown number of times, or even not run at all.
a while loop should contain a boolean expression that determines whether the loop continues or not.

eg: while (variable == yes)
    {
        execute function
    }

## do while loops

the loop will execute the code between the curly braces once, and then it will check the boolean expression. it is guaranteed
to run atleast one time.

do
{

}
while (boolean expresssion);

### 2. for loops

generally used when you want to repeat something a specific amount of times, or when you don't know how many times at the outset
eg it requires a user input

for (int i = 0, i > n; i++)
{

}

## operators in c

### arithmetic operators

+; add
-; subtract
*; multiply
/; divide

We also have the modulus operator % which gives us a remainder eg

int m = 13 / 4; // m is now 1

shorthand versions:

x = x * 5 can also be notated as x*=5
x = x + 1 can also be notated as x++
same with x--

### boolean expressions

All boolean expressions evaluate to one of two values; true or false 

You don't always have to use boolean type variables when working with bools because in C, everyone non-zero value is true; ie an integer of value 3 is true. Only an integer of 0 is considered false.

The two main types of bools are logical operators and relational operators

#### Logical operators with bool

with two variables (x and y)

Logical and (&&):

x = true & y = true (x && y) == true
x = true & y = false == false

Logical or (||):

x = true & y = false == true
x = false & y = true == true

Logical not (!):

 x          !x
 true       false
 false      true

 ##### Relational operators

 less than (x < y )
 less than or equal to (x <= y>)
 greater than (x > y)
 greater than or equal to (x >= y)

 ##### Equality of inequality

 equality (x ==y )
 inequality (x != y)
